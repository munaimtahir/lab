# Goals
- Deliver a production-ready LIMS with: patient registration, orders, sample collection, result entry, verification, reporting (PDF), and audit logs.
- Quality bar: 100% test coverage (backend + frontend), type-safe code, reproducible builds, one-command dev environment.
- CI/CD: lint, type-check, test, coverage gates, container builds, and deploy artefacts.
- Docs-first approach: every feature comes with user story, API contract, schema, and tests.
