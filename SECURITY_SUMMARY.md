## Security Scanning Results

### CodeQL Analysis
✅ **JavaScript/TypeScript**: No security vulnerabilities found

### GitHub Advisory Database Scan

#### Django Vulnerabilities Found

**Current Version:** Django 5.2.7

##### Vulnerability 1: Denial-of-Service (DOS) on Windows
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Affected Versions:** Django >= 5.2a1, < 5.2.8
- **Patched Version:** Django 5.2.8
- **Description:** DOS vulnerability in HttpResponseRedirect and HttpResponsePermanentRedirect on Windows
- **Impact:** This application is deployed on Linux (Docker), so this vulnerability does not apply
- **Status:** ✅ Not Applicable (Linux deployment)

##### Vulnerability 2: SQL Injection via _connector keyword
- **Severity:** High
- **Affected Versions:** Django >= 5.2a1, < 5.2.8
- **Patched Version:** Django 5.2.8
- **Description:** SQL injection possible via _connector keyword argument in QuerySet and Q objects
- **Impact:** This is a critical vulnerability that should be addressed
- **Status:** ⚠️ **REQUIRES UPDATE**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required

1. **Upgrade Django to 5.2.8+**
   ```bash
   # Update backend/requirements.txt
   Django==5.2.8  # or latest stable version
   
   # Rebuild backend container
   docker compose build backend
   docker compose up -d backend
   ```

2. **Test After Upgrade**
   - Run all backend tests: `docker compose exec backend pytest`
   - Verify API endpoints still work
   - Check for any breaking changes in Django 5.2.8 release notes

### SSL Configuration in Dockerfiles

The current Dockerfiles disable SSL verification for package installation to work around self-signed certificates in CI/CD environments. This is acceptable for CI/CD but should be noted:

**Current Approach:**
- `pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`
- `npm config set strict-ssl false`
- `pnpm config set strict-ssl false`

**Security Impact:**
- Medium risk: Package integrity cannot be fully verified during build
- Mitigated by using pinned versions in requirements.txt and package-lock files

**Production Recommendation:**
- Configure proper SSL certificates in the CI/CD environment
- Remove SSL bypass flags once certificates are properly configured
- Use private package mirrors with valid SSL certificates if possible

## Other Security Considerations

### 1. Default Credentials
⚠️ **Critical**: Default credentials are hardcoded in `.env` file
- Database password: `lims`
- Django secret key: `replace-me`
- Admin password: `admin123`

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Generate secure Django secret key
python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'

# Generate secure database password
openssl rand -base64 32

# Change admin password after deployment
docker compose exec backend python manage.py changepassword admin
```

### 2. ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration
✅ **Status**: Properly configured
- Includes VPS IP: `172.235.33.181`
- Includes localhost for internal health checks: `localhost, 127.0.0.1`
- Does not allow all hosts (no `*`)

### 3. DEBUG Mode
✅ **Status**: Properly configured
- Set to `False` in production environment
- Only enabled in local development

### 4. HTTPS/SSL
⚠️ **Missing**: No SSL/HTTPS configured yet
- Port 443 is exposed but not configured
- All traffic currently over HTTP

**Recommendation:**
- Configure Let's Encrypt SSL certificate
- Update nginx configuration for HTTPS
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- Update CORS/CSRF origins to use `https://`

### 5. Static Files
✅ **Status**: Properly configured
- Served by nginx (efficient)
- Django static files collected and served separately
- No sensitive data in static files

### 6. Database Security
⚠️ **Needs Improvement**:
- Database password is weak (default: `lims`)
- No SSL connection to database (internal Docker network)
- No database backups configured

**Recommendation:**
- Use strong database password
- Configure regular automated backups
- Consider database connection pooling

### 7. CORS Configuration
✅ **Status**: Properly configured
- Only allows specific origins (VPS IP)
- No wildcard CORS enabled
- CSRF protection enabled

## Vulnerability Summary

| Issue | Severity | Status | Action Required |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Django SQL Injection (CVE) | High | ⚠️ Open | Upgrade to Django 5.2.8+ |
| Django DOS on Windows | Medium | ✅ N/A | Not applicable (Linux) |
| SSL Bypass in Build | Medium | ⚠️ Accepted | Document and monitor |
| Default Credentials | High | ⚠️ Open | Change before production |
| Missing HTTPS | Medium | ⚠️ Open | Configure SSL certificate |
| Weak DB Password | Medium | ⚠️ Open | Change before production |
| No Database Backups | Low | ⚠️ Open | Set up backup schedule |

---

## Testing Performed

✅ **CodeQL Security Scan**: Passed (0 vulnerabilities)  
✅ **GitHub Advisory Scan**: Completed (Django CVEs identified)  
✅ **Container Health Checks**: All passing  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All functional  
✅ **Authentication**: Working correctly  
✅ **CORS/CSRF**: Properly configured

## Pre-Production Checklist

Before deploying to production VPS, complete these security tasks:

- [ ] Upgrade Django to 5.2.8 or later
- [ ] Change database password to secure random value
- [ ] Generate new Django SECRET_KEY
- [ ] Change admin user password
- [ ] Configure SSL/HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
- [ ] Update CORS/CSRF origins to use HTTPS
- [ ] Set up automated database backups
- [ ] Review and harden firewall rules
- [ ] Enable fail2ban or similar intrusion prevention
- [ ] Set up log monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Document incident response procedures

---

## Conclusion

The Docker deployment is functional and ready for development/testing use. However, **several security items must be addressed before production deployment**, particularly:

1. **Django upgrade to 5.2.8+** (SQL injection vulnerability)
2. **Change all default credentials**
3. **Configure SSL/HTTPS**

The deployment is secure for a development environment but requires hardening for production use.
